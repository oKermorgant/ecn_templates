 Do not forget to check each reference while importing in your Bibtex file.
 Especially, IEEExplore export may lead to ill-formatted conference name like \emph{Robotics and Automation, 
 IEEE International Conference on}.

 \chapter{Actual work}
  
 
 When dealing with rectangled triangles (see Figure \ref{triangle}) I sometimes used this theorem from \cite{pythm001}:
 \begin{equation}\label{theo}
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
 \end{equation}The demonstration is in Appendix \ref{sec:prooftheorem}.
 
 \begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{triangle1}
  \caption{A triangle with letters} \label{triangle}
 \end{figure}
 
 


 
 
 \chapter{Experiments}
 
 When trying to draw a rectangled triangle, my program comes up with Figure \ref{triangle2} that is neither rectangled nor a triangle.
 
  \begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{triangle2}
  \caption{Triangle drawn by my program. Note the 4th side.} \label{triangle2}
 \end{figure}
 
Unless there is a bug in my program, which is unlikely, this research indicates that the whole theory on triangles having 3 sides has been wrong for years, maybe decades.
 
 
 \chapter*{Conclusion}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
 
 
In this thesis we have shown that triangles may have up to four sides \footnote{At least on my computer}.\\


  Also, really do not forget to {\bf check each reference} while importing in your Bibtex file. This is done one for each reference and you know you are good to go afterwards..
